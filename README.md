## Collaborative Filtering 

We have uses two approchases: -

# 1. User based Filtering

This approach identifies similar users based on their interactions with items and recommends items that similar users have liked or interacted with.


# 2. Collaborating Filtering using Matrix factorization - 

This approach models the user-item interaction matrix as the product of two lower-dimensional matrices (user and item matrices). It learns latent features that represent user preferences and item attributes and uses these features to make recommendations.Once the matrices are learned, predictions can be made for unseen user-item pairs by computing the dot product of the corresponding latent vectors. These predictions can then be used to recommend movies to users based on their predicted ratings.
